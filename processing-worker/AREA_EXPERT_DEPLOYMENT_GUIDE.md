# Area Expert Integration - Deployment Guide

## ✅ Status: TESTED & PRODUCTION READY

The Area Expert API integration has been implemented, tested, and is ready for production deployment.

## What Was Built

### Automatic Area Expert Triggering
When a user provides both:
1. **Location** (e.g., "Dubai Marina", "JBR", "Downtown")
2. **Transaction Type** (buy or rent)

The system automatically calls the Area Expert API in the background to enrich the lead with area-specific expertise.

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
1. `src/services/area_expert_service.py` - Area Expert API integration
2. `test_area_expert.py` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `debug_area_expert.py` - Production debugging tool
4. `run_area_expert_test.sh` - Test runner script
5. `AREA_EXPERT_INTEGRATION.md` - Technical documentation
6. `AREA_EXPERT_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Test results
7. This file - Deployment guide

### Modified Files
1. `src/services/agent_history.py` - Now returns lead_id and interaction_id
2. `main.py` - Added area expert trigger logic

## How to Deploy

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure these environment variables are set:
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ✅
- `SUPABASE_URL` ✅  
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ✅

### 2. Deploy to Cloud Run
```bash
cd /Users/arun/Code/Propzing/v2/prop8t/whatsappAgent

# Deploy processing worker (includes area expert integration)
./deployment/deploy-processing.sh
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
After deployment, check logs for these indicators:

**Successful Trigger:**
```
🎯 [AREA_EXPERT_TRIGGER] Ready! Area: Dubai Marina, Type: rent
📍 [AREA_EXPERT] Lead ID: <uuid>
💬 [AREA_EXPERT] WhatsApp Interaction ID: <uuid>
✅ [AREA_EXPERT] Successfully called area expert API
```

**Not Yet Ready:**
```
🔍 [AREA_EXPERT_TRIGGER] Not ready yet - area: None, transaction_type: rent
```

## How to Test After Deployment

### Method 1: Real WhatsApp Conversation
1. Send a message to your WhatsApp bot
2. Provide transaction type: "I want to rent"
3. Provide location: "in Dubai Marina"
4. Check Cloud Run logs for area expert trigger

### Method 2: Using Debug Script (Production)
```bash
# SSH into Cloud Run instance or run locally with production env
python debug_area_expert.py +971501234567

# Or list all sessions
python debug_area_expert.py list
```

## Monitoring

### Success Metrics
Monitor these log patterns in production:

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `🎯 [AREA_EXPERT_TRIGGER] Ready!` | Area expert being triggered |
| `✅ [AREA_EXPERT] Successfully called` | API call successful |
| `🆔 [AGENT_HISTORY] Lead ID:` | Lead ID captured |
| `💬 [AGENT_HISTORY] WhatsApp Interaction ID:` | Interaction ID captured |

### Debug Patterns
If area expert not triggering:

| Pattern | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| `🔍 [AREA_EXPERT_TRIGGER] Not ready yet` | Missing area or transaction type |
| `🔍 [AREA_EXPERT_CHECK] Requirements found: {}` | No requirements stored |
| `⚠️ [AREA_EXPERT] Area expert API returned non-200` | API error (non-critical) |

### Cloud Run Logs Query
```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
resource.labels.service_name="processing-worker"
jsonPayload.message=~"AREA_EXPERT"
```

### Key Features
✅ **Non-blocking:** Runs in background, doesn't slow conversation  
✅ **Robust:** Errors won't break chat flow  
✅ **Smart:** Deduplication prevents duplicate calls  
✅ **Comprehensive:** Detailed logging for debugging  

## API Details

### Endpoint
```
POST https://wpxcvnipnmdvdhrnlfed.supabase.co/functions/v1/info_area_expert
```

### Request Body
```json
{
  "area": "Dubai Marina",
  "rent_buy": "rent",
  "org_id": "4462c6c4-3d71-4b4d-ace7-1659ebc8424a",
  "lead_id": "610bd59b-f297-4bd7-98c4-80cafca1240b",
  "whatsapp_interaction_id": "1e484b88-8862-4164-b69d-f6bd81de2d92",
  "whatsapp_business_account": "543107385407042"
}
```

### Expected Response (Success)
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Area expertise added"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Area expert not triggering

**Check 1: Are requirements being extracted?**
```bash
# Look for this in logs
grep "AREA_EXPERT_CHECK" logs.json
```

You should see:
```
🔍 [AREA_EXPERT_CHECK] Requirements found: {location: "X", transaction_type: "Y"}
```

**Check 2: Are IDs being captured?**
```bash
# Look for these in logs
grep "Lead ID" logs.json
grep "WhatsApp Interaction ID" logs.json
```

**Check 3: Debug a specific user**
```bash
python debug_area_expert.py +971501234567
```

### Issue: API returns errors

This is **non-critical** and won't break the conversation. Check:
- Is the lead_id a valid UUID?
- Does the lead exist in the database?
- Is the area expert API endpoint accessible?

Errors are logged but don't stop the chat:
```
⚠️ [AREA_EXPERT] Area expert API returned non-200: 404
```

### Issue: Duplicate calls

The system has built-in deduplication:
```
⏭️ [AREA_EXPERT] Already triggered for this interaction, skipping
```

This is **correct behavior** and prevents duplicate API calls.

## Performance Impact

### Latency: ✅ ZERO
- Area expert runs in background
- User sees response immediately
- No waiting for API calls

### Resource Usage: ✅ MINIMAL
- Async task uses minimal memory
- Automatic cleanup of old tracking data
- No database connections held

### Error Handling: ✅ ROBUST
- Errors logged but don't break flow
- User conversation continues normally
- Graceful degradation

## Rollback Plan

If you need to disable area expert integration:

### Option 1: Comment out the trigger (Quick)
In `main.py`, comment out lines 773-781:
```python
# asyncio.create_task(_handle_post_response_updates(
#     text_message=text_message,
#     agent_response=agent_response,
#     ...
# ))
```

### Option 2: Feature Flag (Better)
Add to `src/config.py`:
```python
AREA_EXPERT_ENABLED = os.getenv("AREA_EXPERT_ENABLED", "true").lower() == "true"
```

Then in `main.py`:
```python
if config.AREA_EXPERT_ENABLED:
    asyncio.create_task(_handle_post_response_updates(...))
```

## Support
